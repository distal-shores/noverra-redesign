        <p>We believe that great people and great leaders grow and build exceptional companies. This belief is actioned by our commitment
        to proactively developing and delivering leadership development programing across our companies.</p>
        <p>Our Leadership Development approach starts with a fundamental premise, that everybody, regardless of their responsibilities, can be a Leader. Regardless
        of whether or not one is responsible for the management of other people, we are all responsible for our own success and how
        we influence the success of others; for us, this is the definition of “Leadership”.</p>

        <h4 class="section-description">Our Leadership Development Programming has four pillars:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><h5>Leading Self: the habits of great personal leadership</h5></li>
          <li><h5>Leading Teams: the capacity and capabilities to support others to be their best</h5></li>
          <li><h5>Leading Businesses: the capacity to lead through layers</h5></li>
          <li><h5>Managing the Business System: successfully managing the architecture of functions in a business</h5></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="section-description-block box-shadow">In addition, we support key management and executives with tools based learning opportunities across key areas, such as:</h4>
