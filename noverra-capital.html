          Noverra is actively seeking acquisitions for our group of companies. We deploy our own equity capital, earned from the after-tax
          cash flows of our Operating Businesses, giving us full flexibility to customize transaction structures to align to the goals
          of selling and retiring business owners. We have an indefinite investment horizon. We do not intend to sell our group companies,
          but rather aim to continue their proven success, and further invest in the development of the management and people over
          the long run, which we think of as decades into the future.

            <h4>What We Bring to Transitioning Business Owners</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Financial Capacity to Close: we deploy our own equity, earned through cash-flow generation of our group of companies, providing
              the financial capacity to close successfully without the complexity and time span of sourcing outside equity capital</li>
              <li>Flexibility: given we deploy our own equity capital, and have indefinite investment horizons, we have flexibility to create
              transition structures that align to the goals and objectives of various exiting business owners</li>
              <li>Strategic Support: for businesses whoâ€™s senior management, outside of the transitioning owner, are not currently at the level
              where they can be fully strategically and financially responsible for the company, reporting directly to financial owners
              or a board, our Support Services provide the assistance required to successfully lead the company, thereby enabling a transition
              that may otherwise be challenging for a retiring business owner</li>
              <li>Leadership Development: we have a bias towards developing the existing team, as opposed to transitioning in new management;
              and therefore, the management teams and key staff can continuing to have the opportunity to develop their careers, as opposed
              to being transitioned along with the retiring business owner</li>
