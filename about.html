              <p>Noverra Support Services provides strategic support for each of our operating businesses enabling the leadership teams to
              develop and execute effective strategies for continued success of the business. We have found that many companies have strong
              sales and operational management, but that many business owners who wish to transition out of their companies have been solely
              responsible for the financial and strategic elements of the business. Noverra Support Services has been developed to enable
              transitions for exiting owners which may otherwise be challenging due to the strategic gap left in successful companies when
              the owner retires.</p>

              <p>Noverra Leadership Development delivers and deploys leadership development content and shares best practices from across
              our group, to our operating company executives, managers and staff, enabling us to proactively develop the capabilities of
              the teams that successfully lead our group companies. We have a bias towards developing the existing teams as opposed to
              bringing in new management teams. The capacity of our leaders, managers and staff in each of our operating companies is the
              constraint for our growth and continued success; our leadership development programs enable us to continuously grow this
              capacity.</p>
